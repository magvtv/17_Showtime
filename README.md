# 17_Showtime: Cinema Landing Page

- The codename is how I serially categorize my project on my system. Anyway, this is a cinema landing page project built using React.js. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for movie enthusiasts to explore movies, view showtimes, and book tickets. 
- Because Century Cinemax sounds a bit long (i feel it will pick up though), lately i have been thinking of CineMagic and MovieMania 

## Features

- **Movie Listing**: Browse a collection of movies with details like title, genre, duration, director, actors, and rating.
- **Showtimes**: Check the showtimes for each movie at different theaters, along with available tickets.
- **Theater Information**: View information about the theaters, including their names, locations, and seating capacity.
- **Booking**: Book tickets for preferred showtimes by selecting the desired movie, theater, and available seats.
